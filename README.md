## This is a List of my Sandbox Projects I have worked on to learn how to navigate popular APIs:

This Responsive Parcel.js App queries the Reddit API and displays Reddit Post Results in any order.
* [News App](https://github.com/viclotana/NewsApp)

From News API
* [Google Pets](https://github.com/viclotana/Google-Pets)
